-	Brochures are great as a leave behind for meetings and sales calls or as a take away in your office or trade show booth. 
-	Direct marketing is the opposite of brochures and it is the trickiest of all copywriting because: it’s all about the pitch and you’re marketing to a customer in a way that the customer may perceive as intrusive. – use it to establish contact with a new audience or re-establish contact with an old one
-	Poster: A lot of information in a small space
-	Script (Non-written copy), One-liner (social media posts, airplane banners)

Straight shot – when customers are already familiar with your product and want to buy it.

Writing the 1st draft
If you’re stuck from the beginning, start from the middle. 
Writing the introduction first is usually a blocker. 
Give it a structure
Don’t focus on grammar, spelling or diction just yet.
Write one piece per timed sprint. 
If you have to stop, scribble you next thought before you leave. 
Keep the goal in mind

General rules to observe
1.	Address the reader – use your instead of ones -> becomes more engaging. 
2.	Aim to connect with the customers not to rank for SEO
3.	Avoid sarcasm – copy writing is not a great place for subtlety 
4.	Explain why – for example society spends x dollars on head injuries a year/ mortality rates from head injuries/ life altering accidents, etc. – link it with the HH1’s ability to withstand pressure (answering the question, so what?)
5.	Be direct. 

Polishing the Draft
Rules for polishing the draft: 
-	Get someone else to proofread
-	Use active voice as much as possible
-	Don’t use 2 words, where one will do – see exercise files. These tend to bloat your copy. 
-	Make it clear – avoid local vernacular or clichés. 
Book to look at – Collins complete writing guide, Oxford Guide to Plain English
-	Finally, effectively proofread and correct spelling and grammar mistakes.
